=============

A way to set schedules in PagerDuty that sort of approaches sane. Room for improvement exists.

Schedule information is read in via YAML, and the resulting schedule is created in PagerDuty via overrides.

Please view `pagerdutyduty --help` for more information and check out the example schedule `examples/schedule.yaml`.
